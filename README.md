# Tool for clustering embeddings

So far, just a simple script to run a bunch of sklearn clustering algorithms
on embeddings in word2vec format.

## Clustering times

Of facebook embeddings:
* wiki.en.vec, k=100: 19276 seconds (on derwent), 44488 seconds (on zeus)
* wiki.en.vec, k=500:   (on derwent)
