# Tool and experiments for clustering embeddings

Basic idea: can clusters derived from pre-computed embeddings 
be useful in certain ML tasks (e.g. POS tagging, replacing brown clusters)?

Is it even possible to find reasonable clusters and what would they look like?


## Clustering times

Of facebook embeddings:
* wiki.en.vec, k=100: 19276 seconds (on derwent), 44488 seconds (on zeus)
* wiki.en.vec, k=500:   (on derwent)
